Project 11

Build a Course Rating API With Express
======================================

In this project, you'll create a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to review educational courses: users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course.

To complete this project, you'll use your knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with Mongoose and MongoDB for data modeling, validation, and persistence.

Before you start
----------------

To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

-   #### Download the project files. We've supplied the following files for you to use:

    -   The `seed-data` folder contains seed data for your database that can be used in conjunction with the [mongoimport](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/) command line utility.
    -   The `src` folder is where you'll be building your Node.js REST API. We've provided some files to get you started.
        -   The `index.js` file configures Express to serve a simple REST API. We've also configured the `morgan` npm package to log HTTP requests/responses to the console.
        -   We've included a `.gitignore` file to ensure that the `node_modules` folder doesn't get pushed to your GitHub repo.
        -   The `CourseAPI.postman_collection.json` file is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore your REST API.
        -   The `nodemon.js` file configures the nodemon Node.js module, which we are using to run your REST API.
        -   The `package.json` file is the project's npm configuration, which includes the project's dependencies.

-   #### Ensure that you have MongoDB installed.

    -   Open a `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command `mongod` (or `sudo mongod`) to start the MongoDB daemon.
    -   If that command failed then you'll need to install MongoDB.
    -   [How to Install MongoDB on Windows](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/mongo-windows.html)
    -   [How to Install MongoDB on a Mac](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html)

-   #### Seed your MongoDB database with data.

    -   If you haven't already done so, open a `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command `mongod` (or `sudo mongod`) to start the MongoDB daemon.
    -   Open a second `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X) instance.
    -   Browse to the `seed-data` folder located in the root of the project.
    -   Run the following commands:

    ```
    mongoimport --db course-api --collection courses --type=json --jsonArray --file courses.json
    mongoimport --db course-api --collection users --type=json --jsonArray --file users.json
    mongoimport --db course-api --collection reviews --type=json --jsonArray --file reviews.json
    ```

-   #### We've provided you with a basic project to get started. When developing your REST API, just add your code to the `src` folder. You'll need to run the provided Node.js Express application locally and use Postman to test your REST API.

    -   Open a `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X and Linux) instance and browse to the root project folder.
    -   Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
    -   Run the command `npm start` to run the Node.js Express application using `nodemon`. Using `nodemon` gives you the ability to leave your application running while you edit your application's code (`nodemon` will restart your Node.js application when it detects that you've made changes to your code).
    -   As you build your routes, you can see what information it sends back with Postman using the preconfigured requests in the collections file included in the project.
    -   You can press `Ctrl-C` to stop the Node.js REST API.

-   #### Postman is a great Chrome App that you will use to explore and test REST APIs. To help you jumpstart the exploration process, we've provided you with a collection of Postman requests as part of the project files. Here's how to load the provided collection into Postman:

    -   If you haven't already, install Postman. Links and instructions are available on their website at <https://www.getpostman.com/>.
    -   Once you have Postman installed and open, click on the "Import" button in the top left hand corner of the application's window.
    -   In the opened dialog, click the "Choose Files" button and browse to the folder that contains your project files.
    -   Select the `CourseAPI.postman_collection.json` file.
    -   You should now see the `Course API` collection in the left hand pane of the main Postman window.
    -   Click on one of the available requests to load it into a tab. Click on the `Request` button to issue the request to the local server.
    -   Be sure that your REST API is currently running (see the previous project step for details).
    -   When testing for user authorization at `GET /api/users`, make sure to set Authorization Type in postman to Basic Auth to enter the user's email and password.

-   #### As you build out your REST API, you'll naturally encounter errors and unexpected behavior. Here are some reminders and suggestions on how to debug your REST API.

    -   If Node.js crashed as a result of the error, you can look in the `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X and Linux) window and see the exception information.
    -   Sometimes errors don't result in exceptions, but instead are returned as `400` or `500` HTTP status codes. Errors returned from your REST API will be logged in Postman.
    -   For a deeper, more detailed analysis of the state of your application, you can use Google Chrome to debug your Node.js application.

Project Instructions
--------------------

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

-   #### Set up a database connection.

    -   Use `npm` to install Mongoose.
    -   Using Mongoose, create a connection to your MongoDB database.
    -   Write a message to the console if there's an error connecting to the database.
    -   Write a message to the console once the connection has been successfully opened.

-   #### Create your Mongoose schema and models. Your database schema should match the following requirements:

    -   User
        -   _id (`ObjectId`, auto-generated)
        -   fullName (`String`, required)
        -   emailAddress (`String`, required, must be unique and in correct format)
        -   password (`String`, required)

    -   Course
        -   _id (`ObjectId`, auto-generated)
        -   user (_id from the `users` collection)
        -   title (`String`, required)
        -   description (`String`, required)
        -   estimatedTime (`String`)
        -   materialsNeeded (`String`)
        -   steps (`Array` of objects that include stepNumber (`Number`), title (`String`, required) and description (`String`, required) properties)
        -   reviews (`Array` of `ObjectId` values, _id values from the `reviews` collection)
    -   Review
        -   _id (`ObjectId`, auto-generated)
        -   user (_id from the `users` collection)
        -   postedOn (`Date`, defaults to "now")
        -   rating (`Number`, required, must fall between "1" and "5")
        -   review (`String`)
    -   Mongoose validation gives you a rich set of tools to validate user data. See <http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html> for more information.

-   #### Create the user routes

    -   Set up the following routes (listed in the format `HTTP VERB` `Route` `HTTP Status Code`):
        -   `GET` `/api/users` `200` - Returns the currently authenticated user
        -   `POST` `/api/users` `201` - Creates a user, sets the `Location` header to "/", and returns no content

-   #### Create the course routes

    -   Set up the following routes (listed in the format `HTTP VERB` `Route` `HTTP Status Code`):
        -   `GET` `/api/courses` `200` - Returns the Course "_id" and "title" properties
        -   `GET` `/api/course/:courseId` `200` - Returns all Course properties and related documents for the provided course ID
        -   When returning a single course for the `GET` `/api/courses/:courseId` route, use Mongoose population to load the related `user` and `reviews` documents.
        -   `POST` `/api/courses` `201` - Creates a course, sets the `Location` header, and returns no content
        -   `PUT` `/api/courses/:courseId` `204` - Updates a course and returns no content
        -   `POST` `/api/courses/:courseId/reviews` `201` - Creates a review for the specified course ID, sets the `Location` header to the related course, and returns no content

-   #### Update any `POST` and `PUT` routes to return Mongoose validation errors.

    -   Use the `next` function in each route to pass any Mongoose validation errors to Express's global error handler
    -   Send the Mongoose validation error with a`400` status code to the user

-   #### Update the `User` model to store the user's password as a hashed value.

    -   For security reasons, we don't want to store the password property in the database as clear text.
    -   Create a pre save hook on the user schema that uses the `bcrypt` npm package to hash the user's password.
    -   See <https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/> for more information.

-   #### Create an authentication method on the user model to return the user document based on their credentials

    -   Create a static method on the user schema that takes an email, password, and callback
    -   The method should attempt to get the user from the database that matches the email address given.
    -   If a user was found for the provided email address, then check that user's password against the password given using bcrypt.
    -   If they match, then return the user document that matched the email address
    -   If they don't match or a user with the email given isn't found, then pass an error object to the callback

-   #### Set up permissions to require users to be signed in

    -   Postman will set an `Authorization` header with each request when a user is signed in.
    -   Add a middleware function that attempts to get the user credentials from Authorization header set on the request.
    -   You can use the `basic-auth` npm package to parse the `Authorization' header into the user's credentials.
    -   Use the authenticate static method you built on the user schema to check the credentials against the database
    -   If the authenticate method returns the user, then set the user document on the request so that each following middleware function has access to it.
    -   If the authenticate method returns an error, then pass it to the `next` function
    -   Use this middleware in the following routes:
        -   `POST` `/api/courses`
        -   `PUT` `/api/courses/:courseId`
        -   `GET` `/api/users`
        -   `POST`
